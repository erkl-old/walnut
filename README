   walnut is a sensible configuration format, designed from the
   ground up with readability and Go compatibility in mind.

   Using walnut might look something like this:

     ./conf.wn

         # application configuration file
         http
           host = "localhost"
           port = 8080

         cookie.ttl = 48h 30m

     ./main.go

         conf := walnut.Load("./conf.wn")
         port := conf.RequireInt64("http.port")


   See `go doc github.com/wub/walnut` for specifics.
